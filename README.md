# GCN-Autoencoder-Based-approach-in-Time-Series-Dataset
Implemented GCN-Based Autoencoder to predict the anomaly in ECG Datasets
Nodes = Individual ECG measurements at specific time points
Edges = Temporal relationships showing how time points influence each other
Graph = The complete ECG signal with its temporal dependencies preserved
